    <p>These soft hamburger buns are perfect for burgers, pulled pork, or your favorite sandwich filling. I've gotten a thousand requests for these! Not only are these the perfect shape, but they taste way better than anything that comes out of a plastic bag. The total time takes almost 4 hours, but the actual amount of work involved is maybe 10 minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound all-purpose flour, or as needed - divided</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place yeast into bowl of a large stand mixer; whisk in 1/2 cup flour and warm water until smooth. Let stand until mixture is foamy, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 egg, melted butter, sugar, and salt thoroughly into the yeast mixture. Add remaining flour (about 3 cups).</li>
        <li>Fit a dough hook onto stand mixer and knead the dough on low speed until soft and sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Scrape sides if needed. Poke and prod the dough with a silicone spatula; if large amounts of dough stick to the spatula, add a little more flour.</li>
       
    </ol>
